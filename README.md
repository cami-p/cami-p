### About Me
Hi, I'm **Camille Pon (she/her)**, a second-year computer science major at UC Irvine! I learned Python in my first year, and now I am learning C++ and data structures and algorithms. I also participate in on-campus clubs such as WICS (Women in Information Computer Science) and ICSSC (ICS Student Council). I enjoy problem solving and hope to learn a lot about the different applications of computer science.
